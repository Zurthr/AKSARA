Like animatronics, the pizzeria setting, and even a Herobrine tie-in?! Not sure if it's a mod collab, an ARG, or just wild fan theory fuel, but if Mojang actually drops a spooky update mixing Herobrine lore with FNAF 2 jumpscares, that would be insane. Anyone else heard about this or seen the leaks? What do you think — hype or hoax? 👻",
